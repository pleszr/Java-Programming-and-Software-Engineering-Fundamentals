# Java-Programming-and-Software-Engineering-Fundamentals
I did the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals course. Inside the repository, you can find the code I have written and the resources I've used.

Please note that the course and all content belong to https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming. 

The purpose of this repository is to help others in case they are stuck by providing a working code and to track my own progress & practice git.
